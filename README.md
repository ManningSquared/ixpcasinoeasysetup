# Helix pCasino Config Setup
I want to clarify first and foremost that **I DO NOT WRITE DECENT CODE IN ANY WAY SHAPE, OR FORM.** I am but a simple man who took *literal hours* to get this simple fix done because my reaction to code problems at this point is bashing my head against a wall for several hours until the code works.

To install, do the following:
1. Install pCasino via their instructions.
2. Go to garrysmod/addons/pcasino/lua/perfectcasino/config and open up the sh_config file.
3. From line 25 to line 33 you'll see a list of functions that are intended to add support for whatever currency you're using, specifically helix currency.
4. Delete those lines and paste in the functions that I have in the lua file above


## Understand this might not work for you, and that I ultimately do NOT provide support, just trying to help people out by giving them something that worked for me, or sending them in the right direction.

Don't contact me asking for support or help.
